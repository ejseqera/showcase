## Organizations and workspaces

All resources in the Seqera Platform are managed within organizations, typically named the same as your organization, such as Seqera or Johnson and Johnson. An organization can contain multiple workspaces. Each workspace is an isolated environment that can consist of different users, pipelines, credentials, and compute infrastructure. Workspaces enable user access to the Platform depending on the organizational needs. Typically, teams of colleagues or collaborators will have access to one or more workspaces, and all resources in a workspace (pipelines, compute environments, datasets, etc.) are shared by members of that workspace.

Using workspaces, organization owners can:

- Help research teams segment their work depending on their needs.
- Enable teams to focus on specific activities, such as core R&D or clinical trials with PII, which need to be kept secure.
- Create workspaces for specific internal departments like oncology, neuroscience, or therapeutics.
- Add organization users to workspaces as teams or groups.

Navigate to the `seqeralabs/showcase` workspace which contains all of the relevant entities required for this walkthrough guide.
