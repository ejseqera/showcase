## Organizations and Workspaces

All resources in the Seqera Platform are managed within Organizations, which will typically be named the same as your organization e.g. Seqera or Johnson and Johnson. An Organization can be formed of multiple Workspaces. Each Workspace is an isolated environment which can consist of different users, pipelines, credentials and compute infrastructure, enabling access to the Platform depending on the organizational needs. Typically, teams of colleagues or collaborators will have access to one or more Workspace, and all resources in a Workspace (i.e. pipelines, compute environments, datasets) are shared by members of that Workspace.

With Workspaces, you can:

- Help research teams segment their work depending on their needs.
- Teams can focus on specific activities, such as core R&D or clinical trials with PII, which need to be kept secure.
- Organization owners can create Workspaces for specific internal departments like oncology, neuroscience, or therapeutics.
- Users within an Organization can be added to Workspaces as teams or groups.

Navigate to the `seqeralabs/showcase` Workspace which contains all of the relevant entities required for this walkthrough guide.
