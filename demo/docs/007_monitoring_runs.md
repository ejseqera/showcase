## 2. All runs view

Access the **All runs** page from the user menu in the top right of the interface. This page provides a comprehensive overview of the runs across the entire Platform instance. The default view is all organizations and workspaces accessible to the user. However, you can select visible workspaces from the dropdown next to **View**, and filter for a particular set of runs using any of the following fields:

- `status`
- `label`
- `workflowId`
- `runName`
- `username`
- `projectName`
- `after: YYYY-MM-DD`
- `before: YYYY-MM-DD`
- `sessionId`
- `is:starred`

For example:

```
rnaseq username:johndoe status:succeeded after:2024-01-01
```
